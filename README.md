# Interactive 3D Audio Visualizer
Developed a 3D audio visualizer using Raylib that dynamically deforms a mesh based on real-time audio input, creating an interactive, frequency-responsive visualization.

## Features
Features a 3D sphere mesh that morphs and ripples depending on the amplitude of a selected audio file in real time. Users have the option upload their own audio file in a .mp3, .ogg, .wav format and watch how it effects the sphere. There are also GUI elements which allow options for pausing and playing, effect the frequency, ripples, and intensity values applied onto the sphere, and the option to selectively change your sphere's color based on custom RGB values.
